# A Complete Reproducible Tutorial / Hands-On Workshop

RNA-seq (RNA sequencing) is a powerful and widely used method to study the transcriptome—the full set of RNA molecules expressed in a given cell type under specific biological conditions. Unlike traditional microarrays, RNA-seq provides a high-resolution, quantitative, and unbiased view of gene expression, enabling the discovery of differentially expressed genes, detection of novel transcripts, alternative splicing, and more.

This repository provides a fully reproducible workflow for Bulk RNA-Seq processing, beginning with raw FASTQ files and ending with a complete count matrix ready for downstream analyses.

# Workflow diagram on Bulk RNA seq analysis

Here, we re-process 20 RNA-seq samples publicly available under GSE106305.
The goal: convert raw sequencing data (SRA) → FASTQ → QC → trimmed reads → aligned BAM → gene-level counts → merged count matrix → DESeq2

The workflow covers the two major phases of RNA-seq analysis:

# 1. Data preprocessing — converting raw sequencing reads into a count matrix
# 2. Downstream statistical analysis — differential expression, visualization, and biological interpretation

This repository also contains a step-by-step guide for installing required tools, running commands, organizing output files, and performing DESeq2 analysis in R.

# Bulk RNA-seq Processing Pipeline — Guo et al., 2019 (GEO dataset ID: GSE106305)

A fully reproducible hands-on workflow for processing raw FASTQ → aligned BAM → gene counts → final count matrix using 20 RNA-seq samples (SRR7179504–SRR7179541) from:

This tutorial is inspired by the study by Guo et al. (2019), “ONECUT2 is a driver of neuroendocrine prostate cancer,” published in Nature Communications
🔗 https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-11579-6

The study identifies ONECUT2 as a key transcription factor driving neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC)—a highly aggressive and treatment-resistant form of prostate cancer. Integrating transcriptomic and epigenomic datasets, the authors show that ONECUT2 activates neuroendocrine lineage programs, suppresses androgen receptor signaling, and promotes tumor progression. The work establishes ONECUT2 as a potential therapeutic target in NEPC. 

Note: The original analysis integrates transcriptomic profiling across multiple prostate cancer states.

# Dataset Description

Guo et al. utilize multiple publicly available and experimentally generated datasets, including RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, and additional prostate cancer transcriptomic datasets from GEO and dbGaP. These datasets include bulk RNA-seq profiles of tumor samples, cell lines, and PDX models.

For this workshop, we demonstrate the workflow using a publicly accessible GEO dataset (Accession ID: GSE106305) containing multiple RNA-seq samples across biological conditions. Raw sequencing data are downloaded via SRA Toolkit, and all files are stored in structured directories for reproducibility.

# PART A — Conda Environment Setup

Before running the pipeline, create a dedicated conda environment to ensure consistent versions and reproducible results.

conda create -n rnaseq_env python=3.10
conda activate rnaseq_env

# Install all required RNA-seq tools:

conda install -y -c bioconda fastqc multiqc trimmomatic hisat2 samtools subread

# Tools included:

FastQC: Assess quality of raw FASTQ reads

Trimmomatic: Trim adapters & low-quality bases

HISAT2: Splice-aware alignment

SAMtools: Handle SAM/BAM files

Subread (featureCounts): Gene-level quantification

# PART B — Creating Directory Structure

# Organize your working directory:

mkdir -p BulkTranscriptomics/{FASTQ,FASTQC_Results,TRIMMED,ALIGN,BAM,REFERENCE,COUNTS}

# PART C — Downloading GEO Datasets (SRA)

# Install SRA Toolkit:

conda install -c bioconda sra-tools=3.0.7


# Download FASTQ files using fasterq-dump:

fasterq-dump SRR123456 SRR123457 --threads 10 --progress --split-files


# Or download many files at once with GNU Parallel:

parallel -j 2 'fasterq-dump {} --threads 4 --split-files --progress -O $FASTQ' ::: $(cat srr_list.txt)

# PART D — Downloading Reference Genome & Annotation Files

# Download HISAT2 GRCh38 index:

wget -P $REFERENCE https://genome-idx.s3.amazonaws.com/hisat/grch38_genome.tar.gz
tar -xzf grch38_genome.tar.gz


# Download GTF annotation:

wget -P $REFERENCE https://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-109/gtf/homo_sapiens/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.109.gtf.gz
gunzip Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.109.gtf.gz

# STEP 1 — Quality Control (FastQC + MultiQC)

# Run FastQC:

fastqc $FASTQ/*_1.fastq $FASTQ/*_2.fastq -o $FASTQC_Results -t 10


# Generate summary report:

multiqc $FASTQC_Results -o $FASTQC_Results
